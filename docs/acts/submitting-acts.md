# Submitting Acts to Shows

Submit your acts to events where you'd like to perform.

## How to Submit

1. Go to your act's page or the Acts section of your Dashboard
2. Click **Submit to Show**
3. You'll see a list of events accepting submissions
4. Click on an event to submit your act
5. Your act appears in the event's submission list

## Submission Requirements

- You can only submit to events in companies where you're a member
- The event must be accepting submissions
- The deadline must not have passed
- Each act can only be submitted once per event (but can appear in multiple shows within that event)

## What Happens After Submission

When you submit an act:

1. The producer receives notification of your submission
2. They can review your act details and media
3. They may add your act to one or more shows in the event
4. You'll be notified when your act is added to a show

:::note Edit Access
When you submit an act, you grant producers edit access to that act's details for that event. This allows them to make minor adjustments if needed.
