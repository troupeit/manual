# Creating Events

Events are the container for your shows. An event could be a single-night performance or a multi-day festival.

## Create an Event

1. From your Dashboard, click **New Event**
2. Select which company will host the event
3. Enter the event details:
   - **Title**: Name of your event
   - **Start Date**: When the event begins
   - **End Date**: When the event ends (for multi-day events)
   - **Timezone**: The event's local timezone
4. Click **Create Event**

## Single vs. Multi-Day Events

For a **single-night show**, set the same start and end date.

For a **multi-day festival** or event with multiple performances:
- Set the full date range
- Create separate shows for each day/stage combination
- Performers can submit once and be added to multiple shows
