# Managing Submissions

When performers submit acts to your event, you'll need to review and manage them.

## Viewing Submissions

1. Go to the event page
2. View submissions in the **Submissions** panel
3. Each submission shows:
   - Act name and performer
   - Submission date
   - Act details and media

## Adding Submissions to Shows

Once an act is submitted:

1. Open the show editor
2. Find the act in the **Submissions** panel
3. Click the act to add it to the schedule
4. Or use **Add Act** to search for any act in your company

## Submission Requirements

For a performer to submit an act:

- They must be a member of your company
- The event must be accepting submissions
- The submission deadline must not have passed

## Submission Workflow

```
Performer Creates Act → Submits to Event → Producer Reviews → Added to Show
```

Once submitted, the act appears in your submissions list where you can review the details before adding it to a show.
