# Creating Shows

Each event can have multiple shows (for different days, stages, or venues).

## Create a Show

1. From the event page, click **Add Show**
2. Enter show details:
   - **Title**: Show name
   - **Venue**: Location name
   - **Room**: Specific room or stage (optional)
   - **Door Time**: When doors open
   - **Show Time**: When the show starts
3. Click **Create Show**

## When to Create Multiple Shows

Create separate shows for:

- Different days of a multi-day event
- Different stages at the same venue
- Different rooms at a conference
- Matinee and evening performances

Each show has its own cue sheet, schedule, and live view.
