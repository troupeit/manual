# Adding Acts and Notes

Build your show by adding acts and notes to the schedule.

## Adding any act from members of your company

You can add any act which a member of your company has created. This is useful when people forget
to submit acts to shows, or when you'd like to reuse an older act. 

1. Click the "+ Add Act" button in the show's panel
2. Search by stage name, tag, or all fields. 
3. Enter a search term. The search will update as you type. 
4. Click the name of the Act to add it to your show.
5. Close the modal to return to show by clicking "Close"

## Adding Submitted Acts

1. Open an Event from the main Dashboard, and select or create a show to work on within the event.
2. Find the act in the **Submissions** panel
3. Click the (+) button to the right of each submission you want to add. 

:::tip
You an add multiple acts in whatever order you like. Just click the (+) icon. The number
indicates the order in which the acts will be added (to the end of the show). Clicking *Number All* will
mark all of the acts, in the order submitted. *Clear All* resets your selection. 
:::

When your selection is complete, click "Add to show" at the bottom of the submissions panel.

You can also mark acts as *Alternate*, which flags them as an alternate act for the show,
but does not add them to the show rundown.  

Marking an act as *Reject* will flag the act as rejected, and the submitted act will be removed from the list. 

Alternatively, use the **Add Act** button in the show panel to search for any act in your company

## Changing the Submitted Acts View

There are three view states, changing by clicking the top right button:

 - **Show All**: All acts, except rejected
 - **Show Rejected**: Show acts which have been rejected. You must undo the rejection before adding to any show.
 - **Show Unsched**: Show acts which have been submitted and are not part of the schedule

## Adding Notes

Notes are non-performance items like intermissions or DJ sets. They have text and a duration.

1. Click **Add Note**
2. Enter the note text (e.g., "Intermission", "DJ Set - House Music")
3. Set the duration
4. Choose a color for visual distinction
5. Click **Add**

## Note Colors

Use different colors to quickly identify note types:

For example:

- Blue for intermissions
- Green for DJ/music sets
- Yellow for announcements
- Red for important notices

:::tip
Consistent color coding helps your crew quickly scan the cue sheet.
