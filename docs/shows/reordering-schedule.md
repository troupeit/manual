# Reordering the Schedule

You can reorder items in several ways to perfect your show flow.

## Methods for Reordering

### Drag and Drop
Click and drag items to new positions in the schedule.

### Arrow Buttons
Use the up/down arrows on each item for small adjustments.

### Move Dialog
Click the item number to open a dialog for precise positioning. This is useful when moving items across many positions.

## Removing Items

To remove an item from the schedule:

1. Click the **X** button on the item
2. Confirm removal

:::note
Removing an act from a show doesn't delete the act itself—it just removes it from this show's schedule. The act can still be added to other shows.

## Best Practices

- Place high-energy acts at key moments (opening, closing, post-intermission)
- Allow setup time between acts that need it
- Group similar acts together or deliberately vary the pace
- Consider performer costume change times when scheduling
