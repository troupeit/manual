Your show schedule can include two types of items:

### Acts

Performances with full technical details including:
- Music and media files
- Lighting notes
- MC introductions
- Prop requirements
- Cleanup notes

### Notes

Non-performance items such as:
- Intermissions
- DJ sets
- Emcee segments
- Section dividers
- Sponsor announcements
- Setup time

## Schedule Overview

The cue sheet displays items in performance order with:
- Item number
- Act/note name
- Duration
- Technical information
- Status indicators
