# Transferring Company Ownership

As a company owner, you can transfer ownership of your company to another team member. This is useful when leadership changes or you want to hand off management responsibilities to someone else.

## Who Can Transfer Ownership?

Only the **current owner** of a company can transfer ownership. This ensures that ownership changes are always intentional and authorized.

## Who Can Receive Ownership?

You can only transfer ownership to someone who:

- Is already a **Producer** in your company
- Has an active TroupeIT account

:::tip Why only Producers?
Producers have full access to company management features. Requiring the new owner to already be a Producer ensures they understand how to manage the company before taking ownership.
:::

## How to Transfer Ownership

1. Go to your **Company Settings** page
2. Navigate to the **Danger Zone** section
3. Find the **Transfer Ownership** panel
4. Select the producer you want to transfer ownership to from the dropdown
5. Click **Transfer Ownership**
6. Confirm your decision in the confirmation dialog

## What Happens When You Transfer

When you transfer ownership:

| What Changes | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **New owner** | The selected producer becomes the company owner |
| **Your role** | You remain a Producer in the company |
| **Billing** | Any active subscription is cancelled (see below) |
| **Activity log** | A record of the transfer is added to the company's activity feed |
| **Email notifications** | Both you and the new owner receive confirmation emails |

## Billing and Subscriptions

:::warning Important Billing Information
When ownership is transferred, any active subscription is **immediately cancelled**. Stripe will automatically issue a prorated refund for any unused time on the subscription.
:::

**For the previous owner:**
- Your subscription payments stop immediately
- You'll receive a prorated refund for unused subscription time
- You remain a Producer and can continue using the company

**For the new owner:**
- You'll need to set up a new subscription to continue using paid features
- The company will revert to free tier limits until a new subscription is active
- You can set up billing in the **Plans & Billing** section of Company Settings

## After the Transfer

### What the new owner can do:
- Manage all company settings
- Invite and remove members
- Set up billing and subscriptions
- Delete the company
- Transfer ownership to someone else

### What the previous owner can do:
- Continue as a Producer with full access to events and shows
- Be removed from the company by the new owner
- Have their access level changed by the new owner

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I undo a transfer?
No, ownership transfers cannot be undone. The new owner would need to transfer ownership back to you if you want to regain ownership.

### What if there are no Producers to transfer to?
You'll need to first promote a member to Producer level before you can transfer ownership. Go to the **Access Control** section to change a member's access level.

### Will I lose access to my events and shows?
No. You remain a Producer in the company after the transfer, so you keep full access to all company content. The new owner could remove you or change your access level later if they choose.

### What happens to pending invitations?
All pending invitations remain active. The new owner can manage invitations from the Company Settings page.

### Does this affect other team members?
No. All other members keep their current access levels and permissions. Only the ownership designation changes.
