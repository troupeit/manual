# Inviting Members

There are several ways to invite people to your company.

## Invitation Link

The easiest way to invite members:

1. Go to the company's **Members** page
2. Copy the invitation URL
3. Share it via email, messaging, or your preferred method
4. Anyone with the link can join (if invites aren't required) or request access

## Email Invitations

For more control over who joins:

1. Go to **Members** → **Invite**
2. Enter email addresses (one per line or comma-separated)
3. Select the access level for new members
4. Click **Send Invitations**

## Regenerating Invitation Codes

If your invitation link has been shared too broadly, you can generate a new code. This invalidates the old link.

:::tip Security
Regenerate your invitation code periodically, especially after major events where the link may have been widely shared.
