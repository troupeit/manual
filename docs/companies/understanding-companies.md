# Understanding Companies

A Company in TroupeIT represents your production team or organization.

## What is a Company?

Companies are the organizational unit that brings together:

- **Producers** who create and manage events
- **Stage managers** who run shows
- **Tech crew** who handle sound, lighting, and other technical aspects
- **Performers** whose acts appear in shows

## Multiple Memberships

You can be a member of multiple companies, and each company can have its own events, shows, and members. This is useful if you:

- Produce shows for different organizations
- Perform at events run by different production companies
- Work as a stage manager for multiple producers
