# Creating a Company

A company in TroupeIT represents your troupe, venue, or production organization. It's where you'll manage events, shows, and team members.

## Your First Company

When you first sign up, you can create your **first company for free** as part of your 30-day trial. During the trial, you'll have full access to all features.

## Steps to Create a Company

1. From your Dashboard, click **New** on the Companies card
2. Enter the company name and description
3. Configure company settings (see [Company Settings](/docs/companies/company-settings))
4. Click **Create Company**

As the creator, you automatically become the company **Owner** with full access.

## Creating Additional Companies

Want to manage multiple troupes or venues? You can create additional companies, but there's a requirement:

- **All your existing companies must have active paid subscriptions**

This means you'll need to [subscribe to a plan](/docs/companies/subscription-plans) for your first company before creating a second one.

:::tip One Company, Multiple Events
Most users only need one company. Within a single company, you can create unlimited events (with a paid plan) to manage different productions, seasons, or venues.

3. [Create your first event](/docs/events/creating-events)
