# Real-Time Collaboration

TroupeIT uses WebSocket connections to keep everyone in sync during your show.

## How It Works

All connected users see changes instantly:

- Changes to the schedule appear immediately for all users
- Current cue position is shared across all devices
- Chat messages are delivered in real-time
- Connection status shows who's currently viewing

## Best Practices

### Before the Show
- Test connectivity at the venue
- Ensure all crew have accounts and access
- Brief everyone on using Live View

### During the Show
- Have the stage manager control cue advancement
- Use chat for communication during the show
- Keep devices charged and connected

### Redundancy
- Keep Live View open on multiple devices
- Have a backup plan if connectivity fails
- Consider printing a PDF cue sheet as backup

## Connection Status

The Live View shows who is currently connected. Use this to:
- Verify crew members are online
- See when someone disconnects
- Coordinate handoffs between team members
